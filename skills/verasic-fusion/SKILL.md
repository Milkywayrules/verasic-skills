description: Multi-model fusion for exploration and decision support. Use when the user asks to "fuse", "fusion", "multi-model", "ask several models", runs /verasic-fusion, or wants board-verdict, rfc-review, tradeoff-matrix, research-brief, risk-register, devils-advocate, premortem, stakeholder-lens, or compare-to-status-quo templates across named models (e.g. composer-2.5-fast, glm-5.2-high, gemini-3-flash).

# Verasic Fusion — Multi-Model Orchestration

## Source of truth

| File                            | Role                                           |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `references/fusion-protocol.md` | Full protocol — read first                     |
| `references/helper.md`          | Help text for bare `/verasic-fusion` or `help` |
| `references/models.md`          | Known model slugs and substitutes              |
| `templates/<slug>.md`           | Output shape per template                      |

Never duplicate the protocol in chat — follow it.

## Workflow

1. **Help path** — if the user invokes fusion with no question or asks for help, relay
   `references/helper.md` (adjust path prefix for install root).
2. **Pre-flight** — require question, `mode`, and `models` (≥ 2). No defaults. Validate
   slugs via `references/models.md`. Apply soft cap 4 (warn) and hard cap 6 (block unless
   `acknowledge: proceed with N models`). Validate template extras (e.g. `lens-map` for
   `stakeholder-lens`).
3. **Package prompt** — user question + attachments + your framing/analysis. Subagents must
   not see each other's answers.
4. **Dispatch** — in Cursor: spawn Task subagents **in parallel**, one per model, with
   the model slug from the roster. Each subagent gets the packaged prompt + active template
   path. Readonly tools only.
5. **Curate & deliver** — per `mode` (`verbatim`, `fusion`, `verbatim+fusion`). Never
   rewrite subagent prose in `verbatim`. Surface conflicts. Attribute in `## by model`.
6. **Refuse** — if all subagent outputs are unusable, say so; do not invent fusion.
7. **Degraded** — if Task/subagents unavailable, ask upfront before sequential
   single-context simulation.

## Without subagents

Read `references/fusion-protocol.md` and execute the full workflow yourself, including
degraded confirmation when parallel spawn is impossible.

## Hard rules

- Decision support only — no mutations.
- No default models or mode.
- No silent model substitution.
- Conflicts never silently flattened.
- `composer-2.5-fast` should appear in suggested rosters (user's primary model).

## Templates

Read `templates/<slug>.md` before dispatch when `template:` is set. All nine ship with this
skill — see `references/fusion-protocol.md` registry.
